# UMD-Robert-H.-Smith-School-of-Business-Program-Ranking
Developing a comprehensive database focused on monitoring and evaluating program performance and rankings within the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland. The goal is to provide accurate, timely data, enabling informed decision-making, program quality enhancement, and the ongoing strengthening of the school's competitive position in higher education. The scope is limited to Masters of Science (MS) and Masters in Business Administration (MBA) programs provided by the University of Maryland Smith School of Business in the United States.

The database will support all CRUD operations and follow the guidelines and rules that are listed in the book - ‘Modern Database Management 13th Edition’ by Jeffrey A. Hoffer, V. Ramesh and Heikki Topi.

The database will also cover all concepts related to the DBMS - ER Schema, ER Diagram, Functional dependencies, Normalization, basic and advanced querying using Microsoft Server SQL Management Studio, DML, DDL, and more. The team will ensure that work is divided amongst the four of us covering all the required roles - information systems analyst, database designer, database developer, and application developer.
